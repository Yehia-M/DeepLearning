# DeepLearning

Projects for Deep Learning specialiaztion on Coursera

(1) Implementing Logisitc Regression and Gradient Descent to understand how it's work and building a simple cat classifier with it.

(2) Building L-Layer Deep Neural Network and Improve the cat classifier

(3) Comparision between different optimization algorithms; gradient descent, momentum and ADAM.

(4) TensorFlow Tutorial - Building a neural network to detect hand signs (0-1-2-3-4-5) from image. In the original project, I used TF version 1, but lately, in order to migrate to tf version 2, I updated the code.
Replacing version 1 functions with the newer version equivalents. Calls for sessions are removed and placeholders are no longer available.

(5) Convolutional Neural Network Tutorial:
    
    a- Function for the main building blocks of CNN (Forward propagation, Max Pool, Fully Connected and back propagation)
    b- Using TensorFlow to build CNN to improve the hand sign classifier
