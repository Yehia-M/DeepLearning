# DeepLearning

Projects for Deep Learning specialiaztion on Coursera

(1) Implementing Logisitc Regression and Gradient Descent to understand how it's work and building a simple cat classifier with it.

(2) Building L-Layer Deep Neural Network and Improve the cat classifier

(3) Comparision between different optimization algorithms; gradient descent, momentum and ADAM.
